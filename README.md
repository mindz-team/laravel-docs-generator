    requestInterceptor: function (request) {
        request.headers['X-XSRF-TOKEN'] = getCookie('XSRF-TOKEN');
        return request;
    },

and add method

    function getCookie(name) {
        const nameEQ = name + "=";
        const ca = decodeURIComponent(document.cookie).split(';');
        for (let i = 0; i < ca.length; i++) {
            let c = ca[i];
            while (c.charAt(0) == ' ') c = c.substring(1, c.length);
            if (c.indexOf(nameEQ) == 0) return c.substring(nameEQ.length, c.length);
        }
        return null;
    }

`--only` - Comma separated action that should only be generated in case your controller does not provide whole CRUD<br>
`--except` - Comma separated action that should **not** be generated in case your controller does not provide whole
CRUD<br>
`--security` - Endpoint security. Default is `bearerAuth`

Command generates ready to go annotations. To complete docs you should fill your schema fill according to example. In case you do not know how to generate annotations please refer to [this](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php/tree/master/Examples/petstore-3.0/models) document.
If no limitations have been provided action should generate `Index.php`,`Show.php`,`Store.php`,`Update.php`,`Delete.php` files in resource based folder name.

## Single endpoint documentation
